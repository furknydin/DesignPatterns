Creating an object is often more difficult than using it.
You have a two main problem:
    1. Where create the object
        - Objects are created where only in certain places
    2. How create the object
        - What determines how objects are created is generally their state and dependencies with other objects.
Objects should only be created by those who know their situation and their relationships with other objects very well.
